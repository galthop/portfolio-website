            I'm an aspiring junior, fullstack developer who has just completed
            the Northcoders coding bootcamp. My technical skillset includes
            JavaScript, React, Postgres, Tailwind (which I used to build this
            website!) and more! I am currently studying PhaserJS for a new
            project, and improving and extending some of my existing projects
            below.
